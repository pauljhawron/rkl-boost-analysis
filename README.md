# Rumble Kong League Boost Analysis

This project is a data science project done in Python. It was made in a Jupyter Notebook, so reading the .ipynb file in browser should be formatted well. There is a link to my commentary on Twitter about the details of the analysis at the top of the .ipynb file.

In this, I take to analyzing the buying patterns of Rumble Kong League (RKL) NFTs on the OpenSea marketplace. I got the data from websites created by RKL community members and the sources are linked in the .ipynb file.

Through this project, I showcase a demonstration of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, statistical transformations, and regressions - all while intertwining with relevant industry/business knowledge.
